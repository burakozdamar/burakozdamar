### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is Burak OZDAMAR.

I got my PhD from University of Strasbourg, The Doctoral College of Physics and Chemistry-Physics back in 2016 and I have been working on various projects in different universities particularly in materials science since. In the meantime please enjoy the Polaris star trail I have taken combining 150 photos with 30 seconds of exposure each.
